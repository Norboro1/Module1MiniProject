# Module1MiniProject

A mock landing page showcasing a header and footer that stay in place, a comprehensible color scheme, 
content in the body (heading text, an image with alt text, and a paragraph), and a contact form with a smooth scrolling anchor link in the header.

With a little extra time I decided to make the page a lot more responsive, but it's kind of scuffed and I have much better ideas for doing so in the future.
